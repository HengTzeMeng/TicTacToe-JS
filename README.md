# TicTacToe-JS

# Introduction
The aim is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allow user to play in single-player mode and multi-player mode. A single player mode allows two player to play with each other, Owner can duel with their friends and family. Multi-player mode allow user to battle with AI bots either easy or hard bots, I aim to create two AI bots, one for beginner and the other for advance. Therefore, The aim of implementing a minimax algorithm bot in a advance category is to create an AI opponent that is able to make optimal decisions and play the game perfectly.

The objective of the minimax algorithm is to maximize the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances of winning. It does this by considering all possible moves and their resulting game states, and then selecting the move that leads to the best outcome for the AI. Also, I will be aiming to add a timer for single player mode to make it more challenging.
